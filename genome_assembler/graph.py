        This function accepts a filename or a dictionary as input. When a 
        filename is provided it expects the file to have a particular format. 
        The first line in the file should be something like
            Digraph {
        and the last line in the file should be 
            }
        Besides that, each row in the file encodes an edge. For example,
            A -> B
        denotes a directed edge from a node labeled 'A' to a node labeled 'B'

        When a dictionary is provided, it assumes that each node is key and its 
        values in the dictionary denotes all outgoing edges from the node. For
        example, the graph encoded by following python dictionary
            X = {"A":{"B":1}, "B":{"C":1}}

        has two edges A->B and B->C
